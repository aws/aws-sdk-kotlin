# Custom SDK Build Gradle Plugin - Project Summary

## Overview

I've successfully transformed your rough idea for a Custom SDK Build Gradle plugin into a comprehensive design with a detailed implementation plan. The plugin will enable users to generate custom AWS SDK clients containing only the operations they need, reducing binary size and improving startup times.

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture Approach
- **KotlinIntegration Strategy**: Leverages existing AWS SDK codegen infrastructure via `CustomSdkDslGeneratorIntegration`
- **Build-Time DSL Generation**: Service methods and operation constants generated during plugin build using SPI
- **Transform Integration**: Uses existing `awsSmithyKotlinIncludeOperations` transform for operation filtering
- **Source Set Integration**: Generated code compiles alongside user code in separate source set

### User Experience
- **Type-Safe DSL**: Code-generated service methods prevent configuration errors
- **Compiler Validation**: Invalid operations fail at Gradle configuration time
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatic generation during standard Gradle builds
- **Dependency Notation**: Returns Gradle dependency for use in dependencies block

### Technical Implementation
- **Reuses Existing Infrastructure**: No duplicate model loading or service discovery logic
- **SPI Registration**: Proper integration with existing codegen system
- **Build Cache Support**: Incremental builds and Gradle caching for performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear error messages

## Implementation Plan

The implementation is broken down into 12 structured prompts:

1. **Foundation** (Prompts 1-4): Project setup, KotlinIntegration, service discovery, DSL generation
2. **Core Functionality** (Prompts 5-8): Plugin core, generation task, source sets, build cache
3. **Polish & Integration** (Prompts 9-12): Error handling, testing, SPI registration, final integration

Each prompt includes:
- Clear objectives and implementation guidance
- Git checkpoint instructions with descriptive commit messages
- Integration with previous work
- Test requirements where appropriate

## Key Research Insights

### Transform Implementation
- `IncludeOperations` transform is elegantly simple - only filters operations, automatic dependency resolution
- Operations specified as full Smithy shape IDs (e.g., "com.amazonaws.s3#GetObject")
- Transform handles transitive dependencies automatically

### Codegen Integration
- `KotlinIntegration` SPI system provides perfect integration point
- Existing AWS SDK uses this pattern extensively for customizations
- Can leverage existing `AwsService` utilities and model processing

### Build System Patterns
- AWS SDK already uses Smithy projections with transforms
- Source set integration patterns established in `aws-config`
- Plugin registration through `gradlePlugin` block

## Example Usage

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("aws.sdk.kotlin.custom-sdk-build")
}

val customSdk = awsCustomSdkBuild {
    s3 {
        operations(GetObject, PutObject)
    }
    
    dynamodb {
        operations(PutItem, GetItem)
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation(customSdk)
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review the detailed design** at `./plugins/custom-sdk-build/design/detailed-design.md`
2. **Check the implementation plan** at `./plugins/custom-sdk-build/implementation/prompt-plan.md`
3. **Begin implementation** following the 12-step checklist in the prompt plan

The implementation plan provides clear, actionable steps that build incrementally toward a fully functional plugin. Each step includes proper git checkpointing to track progress and enable rollback if needed.

## Git Checkpointing Guidance

Since you enabled git-only checkpointing, each implementation step includes specific git commit instructions:

```bash
# After completing each prompt
git add src/ test/
git commit -m "feat: implement [description]

- [achievement 1]
- [achievement 2]

Completes Prompt N of implementation plan"
```

This ensures proper tracking of implementation progress and provides clear rollback points if needed.

## Architecture Benefits

The final design provides several key advantages:

- **Leverages Existing Infrastructure**: No reinvention of model loading, service discovery, or codegen patterns
- **Consistent with SDK Patterns**: Uses same codegen system as all other AWS SDK components
- **Automatic Updates**: DSL regenerates when models change during SDK builds
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents configuration errors
- **Performance Optimized**: Build cache support and incremental builds
- **Extensible**: Architecture supports future enhancements

The plugin will integrate seamlessly with the existing AWS SDK for Kotlin while providing the custom SDK generation capabilities you envisioned.
