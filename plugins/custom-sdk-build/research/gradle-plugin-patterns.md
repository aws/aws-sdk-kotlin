# Gradle Plugin Development Patterns Research

## Overview
Research into modern Gradle plugin development patterns, DSL creation, and best practices for plugins that generate code and manage dependencies.

## Key Areas to Investigate
1. Gradle plugin DSL creation patterns
2. Generated source set management
3. Custom dependency notation creation
4. Build cache integration
5. Incremental build support

## Findings

### Gradle Plugin DSL Patterns
- Modern Gradle plugins use the `gradlePlugin` block for plugin metadata
- DSL extensions are typically created using Gradle's extension mechanism
- Type-safe DSL builders are preferred over string-based configuration

### Generated Source Set Management
- Gradle provides built-in support for additional source sets
- Generated code should be placed in `build/generated/sources/`
- Source sets can be configured to depend on generation tasks

### Custom Dependency Notation
- Gradle allows creating custom dependency notations through various mechanisms
- Project dependencies can be created dynamically
- Configuration-based dependencies provide flexibility

### AWS SDK for Kotlin Plugin Patterns
Based on existing `build-support` structure:

- Uses `kotlin-dsl` and `java-gradle-plugin` plugins
- Plugin registration via `gradlePlugin` block
- Existing `AwsService` data class provides model for service configuration
- Integration with Smithy model loading and processing

### Source Set Integration Pattern
From `aws-config/build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
smithyBuild.projections.all {
    val projectionSrcDir = smithyBuild.smithyKotlinProjectionSrcDir(name)
    kotlin.sourceSets.commonMain {
        kotlin.srcDir(projectionSrcDir)
    }
}
```

## Next Steps
- Investigate specific implementation patterns in existing Gradle plugins
- Research Gradle's source set API in detail
- Look into dependency notation creation mechanisms
