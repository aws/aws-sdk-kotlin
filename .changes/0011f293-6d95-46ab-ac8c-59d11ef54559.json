    "description": "Enhance generic codegen to be more KMP-friendly. This is a **breaking change** which means service client artifacts will now include their platform name (e.g., `s3-jvm-<version>.jar` vs `s3-<version>.jar`). Users consuming dependencies through the Gradle Kotlin plugin will have this handled automatically for them.",
