/**
 * An Amazon Web Services region that hosts a set of Amazon services.
 *
 * An instance of this class can be retrieved by referencing one of the static constants defined in this class (eg.
 * [Region.US_EAST_1]) or by using the [Region.of] method if the region you want is not included in
 * this release of the SDK.
 *
 * Each AWS region corresponds to a separate geographical location where a set of Amazon services is deployed. These
 * regions (except for the special [.AWS_GLOBAL] and [.AWS_CN_GLOBAL] regions) are separate from each other,
 * with their own set of resources. This means a resource created in one region (eg. an SQS queue) is not available in
 * another region.
 *
 * To programmatically determine whether a particular service is deployed to a region, you can use the
 * `serviceMetadata` method on the service's client interface. Additional metadata about a region can be
 * discovered using [RegionMetadata.of].
 *
 * The [id] will be used as the signing region for all requests to AWS services unless an explicit region
 * override is available in [RegionMetadata]. This id will also be used to construct the endpoint for accessing a
 * service unless an explicit endpoint is available for that region in [RegionMetadata].
