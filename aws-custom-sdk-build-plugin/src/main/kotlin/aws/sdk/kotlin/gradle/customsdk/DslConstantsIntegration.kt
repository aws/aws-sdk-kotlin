 * Smithy Kotlin integration that generates DSL operation constants during the SDK build process.
 * 
 * This integration extends the existing KotlinIntegration system to generate type-safe
 * operation constants (e.g., S3Operations.GetObject) that can be used in the plugin's DSL.
 * 
 * The integration runs during the existing ./gradlew bootstrap process and generates
 * constants for each service independently.
 * 
 * TODO: This will be implemented in Prompt 2 to extend KotlinIntegration
